## Hi, I'm Evandro! 👨‍💻👋

### 📝 About me 
In love with technology since ever, I write lines of code that help to change the world somehow! 

I've experience with quite a lot of development fields, but my focus nowadays rely on Front End Development and Data Science. I'm currently working with React, for both Web and Mobile environments and the most famous Data Science tools to keep personal projects forward!

### 💻 Technologies and Experiences 
- React (for Web and Mobile development);
- NextJS;
- Node, NPM, Yarn;
- Databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and FireBase;
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy and other Data Science tools;
- Linux (from newbie distributions to Arch Linux);
- Windows — currently using it ;)
- Git and GitHub
- Algorithms
